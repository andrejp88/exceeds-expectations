## Unreleased

- This library's dependency on "silly" should no longer interfere with users' own dependencies on silly.
- The library is now split up into a few different packages. The old import still works, but only imports `expect` and `Expectation` (which should be the only things of interest for now, anyway).


## [0.3.0] 路 2021-02-28

### Changed
- Strings are now enclosed by double quotes in order to improve readability of empty strings and multi-line strings.

### Fixed
- The documentation of `toBeOfType` now correctly refers to `TExpected` instead of `TActual`.


## [0.2.0] 路 2020-12-06

### Added
- Throws an exception if `expect` was called but no assertion was made.


## [0.1.1] 路 2020-12-05

### Fixed
- `toBe` is now legal iff `received `**`is`**` expected` is legal.


## [0.1.0] 路 2020-11-22

### Added:
- `expect` function for starting a chain of assertions
- `toEqual` method for comparing equality
- `toBe` method for comparing identity
- `toApproximatelyEqual` method for floating-point comparisons
- `toSatisfy`, `toSatisfyAny`, and `toSatisfyAll` methods for checking against predicate functions
